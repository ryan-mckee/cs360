1) Describe what the Super Node is and what role it plays in the EXT2 file system. 

A:
The super node contains important information about the filesystem, including the identifier for the filesystem type, the number of inodes, etc

2) Describe what the INODE is and what role it plays in the EXT2 file system.

A:
An inode is a data structure that represents a file and contains information such as its name and other inodes/data blocks

3) If we want inode number 10151 describe the algorithm needed get INODE * pointer pointing at it.

A:
Using mailman's algorithm, we can get the block number of the linear address (10151-1)/8 + inodes_block(10) = 1278.
We can then get the pointer to the inode by taking the block, and adding the offset=(10151-1) % 8 = 6

4) How many blocks can a single INODE * struct have at its disposal?

A:
assuming 12 direct blocks, 256 indirect blocks, 256^2 double indirect blocks, 256^3 triple indirect blocks, 16843020 blocks total?

5) Describe what the content (in a general case) you might find in the block of memory you get from *ip -> i_block[i]

A:
the i_block array contains a list of pointers to disk blocks of the file

6) If `ip -> i_block[0] = 0;` what does that mean?

A:
if the first i_block is 0, then the inode has no direct blocks
